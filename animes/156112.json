The funds for business and personal use are separated. After a set period, he can earn his personal funds according to how much his business funds he has left. The catch? Pei Qian earns more when he makes a loss in his business funds. Happily thinking how easy it would be, with many failed start-ups proving a point, Pei Qian founded his company Tengda and achieved financial freedom through the losses. Unfortunately, fate has other plans for him.","format":"ONA","status":"NOT_YET_RELEASED","episodes":null,"duration":null,"chapters":null,"volumes":null,"favourites":0,"trending":0,"genres":["Action","Drama","Fantasy"],"isAdult":false,"averageScore":null,"popularity":147,"trailer":{"id":"vMh-NdP0u18","site":"youtube"}}
