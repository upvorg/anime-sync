Many of these shards have landed on various places across Earth.\n<br><br>\nWith the arrival of the bronze sword and its shards, a new unlimited energy source has suddenly appeared on Earth. This energy source has since been named Spirit Qi.\n<br><br>\nSpirit Qi is like air, thick in some places and thin in others. As the Federation and other factions gather more shards, they discover more information on cultivation, pill refinement, Spirit Stone refinement, and other techniques. The words on the shards have an ancient feel to them, making it a trend for people to use ancient language.\n<br><br>\nThe appearance of Spirit Qi rapidly makes the original energy sources obsolete and has completely changed people's lives. Not only has the Spirit Internet been formed, Spirit Qi has also changed the course of Human Civilization, causing the world to enter a civilization of cultivation. This would later come to be known as the Spirit Inception Era.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Webnovel)","format":"ONA","status":"FINISHED","episodes":16,"duration":15,"chapters":null,"volumes":null,"favourites":8,"trending":0,"genres":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"isAdult":false,"averageScore":null,"popularity":56,"trailer":null}
